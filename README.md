# ReactJS HackerNews App
* Inspired by https://leanpub.com/the-road-to-learn-react

## Objectives
- Have an understanding of how to build a SPA in React.

## Let's get coding.

### Let's begin with a static version of the app.
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
* Let's take a look around the app. We currently have the the static version of what we want our site to look like.

:question: What is passed to the Search component as ```children``` why would we want to use this approach?


### Now let's start making the app dynamic.
Let's begin by adding the ability to do a search of HackerNews API.

Lets figure out the state needed to be kept in the app.

:question: How would you model the state of this app?

:question: What is unidirectional dataflow in react?

1. The first thing we want to do is to identify what changes  in our app, this is usually what goes in react ```state```. I think the minimum state needed to be kept in our app is: ```query``` and ```results```.

2. Now let's identify where this state should live. The ```query``` string that the user types is kept inside the ```Search``` component. The results from the doing the search should be kept as ```results```. The results are however relevant to the ```table``` Component. This is when we push the state up the component hierarchy. Which means that ```query``` and ```results``` should both live in the state of the App component, which is the shared parent of ```Table``` and ```Search```. So the state kept in the app will be something like: ```{ query, results }```.

Let's go ahead and add this state to the App component.

```
//set initial state
constructor(props) {
  super(props);

  this.state = {
    results: null,
    query: CONST.DEFAULT_QUERY
  };
}
```

Now let's write the functions that manipulate the state:

```
//when the query string changes, update the state accordingly
onSearchChange(event) {
  this.setState({
    query: event.target.value
  });
}

onSearchSubmit(event) {
  const { query } = this.state;
  this.fetchSearchTopStories(query, CONST.DEFAULT_PAGE);
  event.preventDefault();
}

fetchSearchTopStories(query, page) {
  const API_URL = [
    `${CONST.PATH_BASE}`,
    `${CONST.PATH_SEARCH}`,
    '?',
    `${CONST.PARAM_SEARCH}`,
    `${query}`,
    '&',
    `${CONST.PARAM_PAGE}`,
    `${page}`,
    '&',
    `${CONST.PARAM_HPP}`,
    `${CONST.DEFAULT_HPP}`,
  ].join('');

  axios
    .get(API_URL)
    .then(response => response.data)
    .then(result => this._setSearchTopStories(result));
}

_setSearchTopStories(result) {
  const { hits } = result;

  this.setState({
    results: hits
  });
}
```
Since the query state is maintained in the app component but the input is in the Search component, we need a way to let the Search component modify the state maintained in the App component. This is done through callbacks. As well, we need to pass the query value into the Search component.

```
//inside the App render function
<Search
  value={query}
  onChange={this.onSearchChange}
  onSubmit={this.onSearchSubmit}
>
```

Don't forget to update the Search component to receive these callback functions as props:

```
const Search = ({ value, onChange, onSubmit, children }) => {
  return (
    <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={value}
        onChange={onChange}
        className="Search-input"
      />
      <button
        type="submit"
        className="Search-button">
        {children}
      </button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

Now let's see what happens when I change the search input.

:question: Uh-oh an error. What's going on?  

Let's fix it.

### Now pair up and work on the following challenge:
Fork this repo. Checkout the solution branch. Commit any changes you make your fork of this repo.

* Upon clicking the More button, fetch the next page of results.

* When there are no results, the table should show "No result"

* when the user clicks on search, the table should be replaced with the string "loading...".

* when the results are returned from the api, the "loading..." string should go away and we should be able to see the results.

* Add caching of the ajax query to HackerNews. If the user has already searched for a term, use the previous results, otherwise make an API call and cache the results.

### Stretch goal. As a pair:
* add a dismiss button for each result. When the user clicks on dismiss, that result should be removed from the UI.
